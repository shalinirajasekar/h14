H-1B PETITION DISCLOSURE DATA

The H-1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. Every year, the US immigration department receives over 200,000 petitions and selects 85,000 applications through a random process. The application data is available for public access to perform in-depth longitudinal research and analysis. This data provides key insights into the prevailing wages for job titles being sponsored by US employers under H1-B visa category. I utilized the 2011-2016 H-1B petition disclosure data to analyze the employers with the most applications. Analyzing the data helps identify the employers who have filed the most petitions each year.
